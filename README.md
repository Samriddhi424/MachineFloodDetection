A real-time flood detection and analytics system built using Streamlit, OpenCV, and Plotly.  
Designed for Top Dewatering Unit (TDU) applications to monitor flood-like motion in video streams via RTSP cameras.

The application features a live monitoring interface that displays video streams with Region of Interest (ROI) overlays and motion 
detection visualization, along with real-time updates and audio alerts when flooding is detected. 
Implemented a data logging system that captures detailed flood event information including 
start/end times, duration and event count, that gets stored in CSV format. The application also 
includes an analytics dashboard with interactive visualizations using Plotly, displaying daily event 
trends, duration analysis and comprehensive summary statistics. Additional features include 
automatic retry mechanisms for stream reconnection, customizable date range analysis, export 
functionality, and a responsive multi-page interface that allows users to seamlessly switch between 
live monitoring and historical data analysis.
